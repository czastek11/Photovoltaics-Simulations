# Photovoltaics-Simulations
A repository of simple simulations correlated with photovoltaics.

Code is written in matlab livesript.

Here are what each file is for:

lista1AC.mlx
A Schottky junction was created by vaporizing gold on n-type silicon.
Calculate the value of the barrier and the potential embedded in this junction. Allow
the user to choose a temperature in the range of 200 K to 300 K.

lista2AC.mlx
Draw a graph of the dependence of silicon resistivity on dopant concentration for
doping: arsenic, phosphorus and boron. Why does the dependence for boron
differs markedly from the others?

lista3AC.mlx
Using an approximation of the fully depleted region, draw the dependence 
of the charge density, electric field, potential on depth, and the band diagram for a silicon p-n junction.
The junction is in thermo-dynamic equilibrium.

lista4AC.mlx
Solve numerically the one-dimensional Poisson equation for a Schottky junction on n-type silicon with gold:
(a) approximating the fully depleted region,
b) taking into account the free carriers in the depleted region.
Compare and comment on the results. Allow the user to enter the concentration of the semiconductor.

lista5AC.mlx
Using measured data of capacitance-voltage characteristics draw the concentration
and electric field progil for a Schottky junction on p-type silicon.

lista6AC.mlx
A thin layer of SiO2 was applied to a silicon substrate. Calculate the thickness of this layer,
knowing the value of the reflectance for different wavelengths.
The measurement was made in air. The sample was illuminated at right angles to the surface.

lista7AC.mlx
Draw the dependence of the photocell efficiency on the values
of series resistance and leakage in the two-diode model. 
Allow the user to choose the model parameters.
